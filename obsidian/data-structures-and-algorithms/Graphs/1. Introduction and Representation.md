A ***Graph*** is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges. The vertices are sometimes also referred to as nodes and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. More formally a Graph is composed of a set of vertices( ***V*** ) and a set of edges( **E** ). The graph is denoted by **G(V, E)****.

## Representations of Graph

Here are the two most common ways to represent a graph : For simplicity, we are going to consider only ***unweighted graphs*** in this post.

1. Adjacency Matrix
2. Adjacency List

## Adjacency Matrix Representation

An adjacency matrix is a way of representing a graph as a matrix of boolean (0's and 1's)

Let's assume there are ****n**** vertices in the graph So, create a 2D matrix ***adjMat\[n\]\[n\]*** having dimension n x n.

> - If there is an edge from vertex ***i*** to ***j****, mark ***adjMat\[i\]\[j\]*** as ***1***.
> - If there is no edge from vertex ***i*** to ***j***, mark **adjMat\[i\]\[j\]*** as **0***.

### Representation of Undirected Graph as Adjacency Matrix:

The below figure shows an undirected graph. Initially, the entire Matrix is ​​initialized to ****0****. If there is an edge from source to destination, we insert ****1**** to both cases (***adjMat\[source\]\[destination\]*** and ***adjMat\[destination\]\[source\]***) because we can go either way.

![Undirected Graph to Adjacency Matrix](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230727130331/Undirected_to_Adjacency_matrix.png)

```cpp
// C++ program to demonstrate Adjacency Matrix
// representation of undirected and unweighted graph
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void addEdge(vector<vector<int>> &mat, int i, int j)
{
    mat[i][j] = 1;
    mat[j][i] = 1; // Since the graph is undirected
}

void displayMatrix(vector<vector<int>> &mat)
{
    int V = mat.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
    {
        for (int j = 0; j < V; j++)
            cout << mat[i][j] << " ";
        cout << endl;
    }
}

int main()
{

    // Create a graph with 4 vertices and no edges
    // Note that all values are initialized as 0
    int V = 4;
    vector<vector<int>> mat(V, vector<int>(V, 0));

    // Now add edges one by one
    addEdge(mat, 0, 1);
    addEdge(mat, 0, 2);
    addEdge(mat, 1, 2);
    addEdge(mat, 2, 3);

    /* Alternatively we can also create using below
       code if we know all edges in advacem

     vector<vector<int>> mat = {{ 0, 1, 0, 0 },
                               { 1, 0, 1, 0 },
                               { 0, 1, 0, 1 },
                               { 0, 0, 1, 0 } }; */

    cout << "Adjacency Matrix Representation" << endl;
    displayMatrix(mat);

    return 0;
}
```

**Output**

```
Adjacency Matrix Representation
0 1 1 0 
1 0 1 0 
1 1 0 1 
0 0 1 0 
```

### Adjacency Matrix for Undirected and Weighted graph:

Consider an Undirected and Weighted graph ***G*** with 5 vertices and 5 edges. For the graph G, the adjacency matrix would look like:

![Adjacency-Matrix-for-Undirected-and-Weighted-graph](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240424142706/Adjacency-Matrix-for-Undirected-and-Weighted-graph.webp)

Here's how to interpret the matrix:

- ***A\[i\]\[j\] ​= INF***, then there is no edge between vertex i and j
- ***A\[i\]\[j\] ​= w***, then there is an edge between vertex i and j having weight = w.
### Representation of Directed Graph as Adjacency Matrix:

The below figure shows a directed graph. Initially, the entire Matrix is ​​initialized to ***0****. If there is an edge from source to destination, we insert **1** for that particular ***adjMat\[source\]\[destination\]***.

Directed Graph to Adjacency Matrix

### Adjacency Matrix for Directed and Weighted graph:

Consider an Directed and Weighted graph ***G*** with 5 vertices and 6 edges. For the graph G, the adjacency matrix would look like:

![Adjacency-Matrix-for-Directed-and-Weighted-graph](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240424142833/Adjacency-Matrix-for-Directed-and-Weighted-graph.webp)

Here's how to interpret the matrix:

- ***A\[i\]\[j\] ​= INF***, then there is no edge from vertex i to j
- ***A\[i\]\[j\] ​= w***, then there is an edge from vertex i having weight w

### Properties of Adjacency Matrix

- ***Diagonal Entries***: The diagonal entries A\[i\]\[j\] are usually set to 0 (in case of unweighted) and INF in case of weighted, assuming the graph has no self-loops.
- ***Undirected Graphs***: For undirected graphs, the adjacency matrix is symmetric. This means A\[i\]\[j\] ​= A\[j\]\[i\]​ for all i and j.

### Applications of Adjacency Matrix:

- ***Graph Representation***: The adjacency matrix is one of the most common ways to represent a graph computationally.
- ***Connectivity***: By examining the entries of the adjacency matrix, one can determine whether the graph is connected or not. If the graph is undirected, it is connected if and only if the corresponding adjacency matrix is irreducible (i.e., there is a path between every pair of vertices). In directed graphs, connectivity can be analyzed using concepts like strongly connected components.
- ***Degree of Vertices***: The degree of a vertex in a graph is the number of edges incident to it. In an undirected graph, the degree of a vertex can be calculated by summing the entries in the corresponding row (or column) of the adjacency matrix. In a directed graph, the in-degree and out-degree of a vertex can be similarly determined.

### Advantages of Adjacency Matrix:

- ***Simple:*** Simple and Easy to implement.
- ***Space Efficient for Dense Graphs:*** Space efficient when the graph is dense as it requires V * V space to represent the entire graph.
- ***Faster access to Edges:*** Adjacency Matrix allows constant look up to check whether there exists an edge between a pair of vertices.

### Disadvantages of Adjacency Matrix:

- ***Space inefficient for Sparse Graphs:*** Takes up O(V* V) space even if the graph is sparse.
- ***Costly Insertions and Deletions:*** Adding or deleting a vertex can be costly as it requires resizing the matrix.
- ***Slow Traversals:*** Graph traversals like DFS, BFS takes O(V * V) time to visit all the vertices whereas Adjacency List takes only O(V + E).

## Adjacency List Representation

An array of Lists is used to store edges between two vertices. The size of array is equal to the number of ***vertices (i.e, n)***. Each index in this array represents a specific vertex in the graph. The entry at the index i of the array contains a linked list containing the vertices that are adjacent to vertex ***i***. Let's assume there are ***n*** vertices in the graph So, create an ***array of list*** of size ****n**** as ***adjList[n].***

> - adjList[0] will have all the nodes which are connected (neighbor) to vertex ***0***.
> - adjList[1] will have all the nodes which are connected (neighbor) to vertex ***1*** and so on.

### Representation of Undirected Graph as Adjacency list:

The below undirected graph has 3 vertices. So, an array of list will be created of size 3, where each indices represent the vertices. Now, vertex 0 has two neighbors (i.e, 1 and 2). So, insert vertex 1 and 2 at indices 0 of array. Similarly, For vertex 1, it has two neighbor (i.e, 2 and 0) So, insert vertices 2 and 0 at indices 1 of array. Similarly, for vertex 2, insert its neighbors in array of list.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

// Function to add an edge between two vertices
void addEdge(vector<vector<int>>& adj, int i, int j) {
    adj[i].push_back(j);
    adj[j].push_back(i); // Undirected
}

// Function to display the adjacency list
void displayAdjList(const vector<vector<int>>& adj) {
    for (int i = 0; i < adj.size(); i++) {
        cout << i << ": "; // Print the vertex
        for (int j : adj[i]) {
            cout << j << " "; // Print its adjacent
        }
        cout << endl; 
    }
}

// Main function
int main() {
    // Create a graph with 4 vertices and no edges
    int V = 4;
    vector<vector<int>> adj(V); 

    // Now add edges one by one
    addEdge(adj, 0, 1);
    addEdge(adj, 0, 2);
    addEdge(adj, 1, 2);
    addEdge(adj, 2, 3);

    cout << "Adjacency List Representation:" << endl;
    displayAdjList(adj);

    return 0;
}
```

**Output**
```
Adjacency List Representation:
0: 1 2 
1: 0 2 
2: 0 1 3 
3: 2 
```
### Representation of Directed Graph as Adjacency list:

The below directed graph has 3 vertices. So, an array of list will be created of size 3, where each indices represent the vertices. Now, vertex 0 has no neighbours. For vertex 1, it has two neighbour (i.e, 0 and 2) So, insert vertices 0 and 2 at indices 1 of array. Similarly, for vertex 2, insert its neighbours in array of list.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

// Function to add an edge between two vertices
void addEdge(vector<vector<int>>& adj, int u, int v) {
    adj[u].push_back(v);
}

void displayAdjList(const vector<vector<int>>& adj) {
    for (int i = 0; i < adj.size(); i++) {
        cout << i << ": "; 
        for (int j : adj[i]) {
            cout << j << " "; 
        }
        cout << endl; 
    }
}

int main() {
  
    // Create a graph with 3 vertices and 3 edges
    int V = 3;
    vector<vector<int>> adj(V); 

    // Now add edges one by one
    addEdge(adj, 1, 0);
    addEdge(adj, 1, 2);
    addEdge(adj, 2, 0);

    cout << "Adjacency List Representation:" << endl;
    displayAdjList(adj);

    return 0;
}
```

**Output**
```
Adjacency List Representation:
0: 
1: 0 2 
2: 0
```

## Characteristics of the Adjacency List:

- An adjacency list representation uses a list of lists. We store all adjacent of every node together.
- The size of the list is determined by the number of vertices in the graph.
- All adjacent of a vertex are easily available. To find all adjacent, we need only O(n) time where is the number of adjacent vertices.

## Applications of the Adjacency List:

- ***Graph algorithms***: Many graph algorithms like ***Dijkstra's algorithm***, ***Breadth First Search***, and ***Depth First Search*** perform faster for adjacency lists to represent graphs.
- Adjacency List representation is the most commonly used representation of graph as it allows easy traversal of all edges.

## Advantages of using an Adjacency list:

- An adjacency list is simple and easy to understand.
- Requires less space compared to adjacency matrix for sparse graphs.
- Easy to traverse through all edges of a graph.
- Adding an vertex is easier compared to adjacency matrix representation.
- Most of the graph algorithms are implemented faster with this representation. For example, BFS and DFS implementations take O(VxV) time, but with Adjacency List representation, we get these in linear time. Similarly Prim's and Dijkstra's algorithms are implemented faster with Adjacency List representation.

## Disadvantages of using an Adjacency list:

- Checking if there is an edge between two vertices is costly as we have traverse the adjacency list.
- Not suitable for dense graphs.
